#Key Points

* Front-end - browser based environment (think HTML, CSS, jQuery)
* Back-end - desktop and server based environment (Ruby, Rails)
* Scripting language - language which default implementations run then die (Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby)
* Compilation language - language which default implementation stays alive (Java, C)
* High-level - abstractions have obscured away the difficulties and challenges into a nice interface
* Low-level - you're provided with the bare minimum, difficulties and challenges are solved by you
* API (Application Programming Interface) - the things you call to do something with something
* Latency - It is a time interval between the stimulation and response. In general point of view, a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed.
* Throughput - In general terms, throughput is the rate of production or the rate at which something can be processed. When used in the context of communication networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput or network throughput is the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel. 
* Scalability - It is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.[1] For example, it can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.
* Commodity hardware, in an IT context, is a device or device component that is relatively inexpensive, widely available and more or less interchangeable with other hardware of its type.
* Memory Leak: A failure in a program to release discarded memory, causing impaired performance or failure.
* Forward Compatibilty - It will work with future versions of software
* Backward Compatibilty - It will work with previous versions of software

* Design Patterns - In general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem.
      - Singleton: restrict the number of instantiations of a "class" to one.
      - Observers: An object maintains a list of dependents/observers and notifies them automatically on state changes.
      - Factories:It is a creational pattern that doesn't require us to use a constructor but provides a generic interface for creating objects.
      - Dependency Injection: It is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a dependent object.

* Cluster - cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system.
* Sharding - Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple machines and is MongoDB's approach to meeting the demands of data growth. As the size of the data increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to store the data nor provide an acceptable read and write throughput.
* Replication: A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set.
