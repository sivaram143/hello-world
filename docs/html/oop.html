<h3 id="oops">OOPS</h3>
<p>The object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model where Programs are organized around object and data rather than action and logic. </p>
<h3 id="oops-features">OOPS Features</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Class </p>
<ul>
<li>A class is the core of any modern Object Oriented Programming language. </li>
<li>In OOP languages it is must to create a class for representing data. </li>
<li>Class is a blueprint of an object that contains variables for storing data and functions to performing operations on these data. </li>
<li><p>Class will not occupy any memory space and hence it is only logical representation of data.</p>
<pre><code>class Employee
{

}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Object </p>
<ul>
<li>Objects are the basic run-time entities in an object oriented system.</li>
<li>They may represent a person,a place or any item that the program has to handle. &quot;Object is a Software bundle of related variable and methods.&quot;</li>
<li><p>“Object is an instance of a class”</p>
<pre><code> Employee objEmp = new Employee();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Abstraction</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction is &quot;To represent the essential feature without representing the back ground details.&quot; Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.</li>
<li>It provides you a generalized view of your classes or object by providing relevant information.</li>
<li>It is the process of hiding the working style of an object, and showing the information of an object in understandable manner.</li>
<li><p>Eg: Mobile Phone, Application Form (College, doctor)</p>
<pre><code>abstract class MobilePhone
{
    public void Calling();
    public void SendSMS();
}
public class Nokia1400 extends MobilePhone
{

}
public class Nokia2700 extends MobilePhone
{
   public void FMRadio();
   public void MP3();
   public void Camera();
}
public class BlackBerry extends MobilePhone
{
   public void FMRadio();
   public void MP3();
   public void Camera();
   public void Recording();
   public void ReadAndSendEmails();
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Encapsulation</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrapping up data member and method together into a single unit (i.e. Class) is called Encapsulation.</li>
<li>Encapsulation is like enclosing in a capsule. That is enclosing the related operations and data related to an object into that object.</li>
<li>Encapsulation is like your bag in which you can keep your pen, book etc. It means this is the property of encapsulating members and functions.</li>
<li><p>Eg: Mobile Phone and Mobile Phone Manufacturer, TV operation </p>
<pre><code>class Bag
{
   book;
   pen;
   ReadBook();
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Inheritance</p>
<ul>
<li>When a class acquire the property of another class is known as inheritance.</li>
<li>Inheritance is process of object reusability.</li>
<li><p>Eg: A Child acquire property of Parents.</p>
<pre><code>  public class ParentClass
  {
    public ParentClass()
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Parent Constructor.&quot;);
    }
    public void print()
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m a Parent Class.&quot;);
    }
  }
  public class ChildClass extends ParentClass
  {
    public ChildClass()
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Child Constructor.&quot;);
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
    {
        ChildClass child = new ChildClass();
        child.print();
    }
   }
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polymorphism<ul>
<li>Polymorphism means one name many forms.</li>
<li>One function behaves different forms. (or) &quot;Many forms of a single object is called Polymorphism&quot;</li>
<li>Eg: Teacher, Person, Mobile</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<td>Abstraction solves the problem in the design level.</td>

<tr>
<td>Abstraction is used for hiding the unwanted data and giving relevant data.</td>
<td>Encapsulation means hiding the code and data into a single unit to protect the data from outside world.</td>

<tr>
<td>Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it</td>
<td>Encapsulation means hiding the internal details or mechanics of how an object does something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Abstraction- Outer layout, used in terms of design.For Example:- Outer Look of a Mobile Phone, like it has a display screen and keypad buttons to dial a number.</td>
<td>Encapsulation- Inner layout, used in terms of implementation.For Example:- Inner Implementation detail of a Mobile Phone, how keypad button and Display Screen are connect with each other using circuits.</td>

<li>Class            : Blue print of Object </li>
<li>Object           : Instance of Class</li>
<li>Abstraction      : Hiding our irrelevant Data</li>
<li>Encapsulation    : Protecting our Data</li>
<li>Inheritence      : One property of object is acquiring to another property of object</li>
<li>Polymorphism     : Different behaviors at different instances</li>
